## Running Locally

### With Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/codesponsor/codesponsor.git
cd codesponsor
cp code_sponsor/.env-sample code_sponsor/.env
docker-compose up -d
```
Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`.

### Without Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/codesponsor/codesponsor.git
cd codesponsor
cp code_sponsor/.env-sample code_sponsor/.env

```

You will need to edit the `code_sponsor/.env` file with your local environment settings.

### Setup Database

PostgreSQL is the database used by this application. Here are some instructions for installing PostgreSQL on various operating systems.

[OSX](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/)

[Windows](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/)

[Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04)

Once you have Postgres installed and running on your system, enter into a Postgres session.
```
psql
```
Create the database and a new privileged user.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE codesponsor_development;
CREATE USER codesponsor_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE codesponsor_development TO codesponsor_user;
```
Exit Postgres session
```
\q
```
Update the code_sponsor/.env file with the DATABASE ENV:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=psql://codesponsor_user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/codesponsor_development
```


### Startup server


```
pipenv install
pipenv run python manage.py migrate
pipenv run python manage.py createcachetable
pipenv run python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
